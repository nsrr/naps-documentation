## About

The North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy (NAPS) Consortium is an observational study investigating the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration within the central and autonomic nervous system, collectively known as synucleinopathy. Funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), specifically the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the study aims to enable neuroprotective clinical trials to prevent or delay synucleinopathies like Parkinson's Disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA).  The NAPS Consortium was formed to enroll participants with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered a prodromal stage of synucleinopathy, in preparation for future clinical trials.

The consortium's work is conducted in stages:
- NAPS1 (conducted from June 2018 to June 2019) focused on building a large, multi-center cohort, implementing standardized clinical assessments, and developing fluid and neurophysiological biomarkers.
- NAPS2 (conducted from August 2021 to April 2026) expands on NAPS1 with a more extensive protocol and a core-based structure to support its aims. NAPS2 is a non-randomized, longitudinal natural history study that enrolls 300 participants with polysomnogram-confirmed idiopathic RBD and 60 matched healthy controls for annual evaluation.

The overarching goals of the NAPS Consortium are to enroll participants for the standardized collection of longitudinal data, analyze this data to develop biomarkers for designing clinical trials, share data and samples with the scientific community, and prepare for large-scale clinical trials. Participants are followed for periods of up to 10 years after their initial visit.

Primary outcomes are endpoints of neurodegenerative conditions such as PD, DLB, and MSA. In NAPS1, a primary endpoint was the Prodromal Synucleinopathy Rating Scale, which combines assessments of neurocognitive, motor, autonomic, olfactory, and color vision functions. A primary sleep-related endpoint was the quantification of REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) metrics from polysomnography (PSG). NAPS2 is an observational study and does not have primary outcome measures in the traditional sense.

Currently, only polysomnographic data is being made available to the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR). Data requests to other NAPS data can be made using the request form on the NAPS website. Data collection includes:
- Clinical Battery: An annual comprehensive evaluation of cognitive, motor, autonomic, sleep, psychiatric, olfactory, and color vision functions. 
- Blood Draw: Up to 60 ml of blood is collected annually for plasma, serum, DNA/buffy coat, and RNA samples.
- Lumbar Puncture: 20-30ml of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected from willing RBD participants and is mandatory for controls at their first visit
- Polysomnogram (PSG): Full, attended in-lab PSGs are performed on all participants 
- MRI: Performed twice in RBD participants and once in controls
- DaTscan: Performed in all RBD participants without contraindications


## Methods

### Eligibility

Inclusion criteria for the RBD include must have polysomnogram-confirmed RBD according to ICSD-3 criteria, be over 18 years old, and be capable of providing informed consent. Exclusions included a diagnosis of PD, dementia, or MSA, narcolepsy associated RBD, or RBD secondary to other known causes.  Control group inclusion criteria include must be over 18 years old, matched for age, sex, and race to the RBD group, and be willing to undergo all testing procedures, including lumbar puncture and neuroimaging. Control Group exclusions: History of dream enactment behavior, parkinsonism, dementia, MCI, or contraindications to MRI or lumbar puncture.

### Clinic visits

Participants underwent annual comprehensive clinical evaluations. At least two clinic visits and two polysomnograms, separated by at least two years, were planned. The clinical battery includeed a semi-structured interview and assessments across multiple domains.

RBD group procedures included a clinical assessment, questionnaires, blood draw, neuroimaging (MRI and DaTscan), polysomnogram (sleep study), and optional lumbar puncture.
Control group procedures included a clinical assessment, questionnaires, blood draw, neuroimaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture.

**Cognitive Function**: Assessed using tests from the Uniform Data Set version 3 (UDS3), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), King-Devick test, and Pareidolia test<br>
**Neuropsychiatric Function**: Evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Geriatric Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Scale (GAD-7), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and others<br>
**Motor Function**: Assessed with the MDS-UPDRS parts 2 and 3, Timed “Up and Go” test, Purdue Pegboard, and Alternate tap test<br>
**Autonomic Function**: Measured via orthostatic vital signs and the Scale for Outcomes in PD-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT)<br>
**Sensory Function**: Color vision is tested with the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Color Vision Test, and smell is tested with the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT)<br>
**Sleep Function**: Assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), SCOPA-sleep, and Mayo Sleep Questionnaire 

### PSG collection
Attended in-lab polysomnography (PSG) was performed on all RBD and control participants in a controlled, secure environment with continuous technologist monitoring. RBD participants underwent PSG twice (two years apart), while controls had a single PSG. The total recording time was advised to be at least 7-8 hours, with an effort to capture at least 5 minutes of artifact-free REM sleep. Digital video and audio were required for all studies

A variety of digital PSG recording systems were used across the sites, including Natus SleepWorks, Compumedics Grael, Nihon Kohden PSG-1100, and Phillips Alice 6 LDE. PSGs were uploaded to a secure server in EDF format for centralized analysis by the PSG Core. The recommended sampling rate was 500 Hz (minimum 200 Hz).

 The minimum suggested PSG montage included the following channels: 
- EEG (6 channels): F3-M2, F4-M1, C3-M2, C4-M1, O1-M2, O2-M1
- EOG (2 channels): LOC-M2, ROC-M1 
- EMG (Mentalis/Submentalis): Bipolar chin electrodes 
- EMG (Anterior Tibialis): Left and right leg electrodes 
- EMG (Flexor Digitorum Superficialis): Left and right arm electrodes
- ECG: Lead II 
- Snoring: Audio sensor 
- Airflow: Nasal/oral thermistor and nasal pressure transducer 
- Respiratory Effort: Chest and abdominal excursion (e.g., RIP bands) 
- Oximetry: Finger pulse oximeter 
- Body Position: Sensor or technologist observation 

### PSG scoring
All sleep scoring was performed centrally at the Mayo Clinic PSG Core Central Laboratory.  Scoring rules for events like apneas or hypopneas were guided by AASM standards for scoring sleep and associated events.  Accurate notation of the recording period details including time of lights out, and time of lights on was particularly important using the Technologist Log. Additional technologist commented and notationed during the course of recording, as well as any notable dream enactment or other sleep behaviors (i.e., sleep position per epoch and any observed sleep position changes throughout the study, any observed movements, behaviors or vocalizations), timing of breaks in recording and reasons for the interruptions.

## Data de-identification
All personally identifiable information (PII) was removed from the data files by the NSRR team.

## Data overview
### Covariate/phenotype datasets (CSV) 
The covariate dataset files **naps-dataset-0.1.0.csv** and **naps-harmonized-dataset-0.1.0.csv** contain 138 rows each. The first column ([nsrrid](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/naps/variables/nsrrid)) is the unique NAPS subject identifier that can be linked with PSG signal filenames. 

The dataset columns are described in the accompanying data dictionary files. The **variables** data dictionary file [naps-data-dictionary-0.1.0-variables.csv](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/naps/files/datasets/naps-data-dictionary-0.1.0-variables.csv) includes folder names (id), labels (display names), descriptions, and other metadata. Categorical variables also include an associated “domain” (e.g., 1=male, 2=female), which are described in the **domains** data dictionary file ([naps-data-dictionary-0.1.0-domains.csv](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/naps/files/datasets/naps-data-dictionary-0.1.0-domains.csv) ). 

The history of the covariate dataset and data dictionary files have been tracked on GitHub (https://github.com/nsrr/naps-data-dictionary). 

The harmonized dataset **naps-harmonized-dataset-0.1.0.csv** contains the most frequently used demographic variables available in the NAPS dataset. These variables were curated by the NSRR team to allow ready inter-operability with other NSRR datasets. Key harmonized variables include:

|  |  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Variable** | **Label** |
| [nsrr_age](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/naps/variables/nsrr_age) | Subject age |
| [nsrr_sex](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/naps/variables/nsrr_sex) | Subject sex |

### PSG signal files (EDF)
Raw PSG data was collected and will be shared. The data files are converted to European Data Format (EDF) or EDF+ format for centralized analysis and sharing. Video data is also collected but stored locally at each site for future research and is not currently shared due to its identifiable nature. 
The sources state that PSG data, including metadata such as staging and respiratory events, will be shared through the NSRR. However, details on the structure of annotation files (e.g., XML format, coding schemes for events) are not specified.
[Raw polysomnography data](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/naps/files/polysomnography) are available for ??? NAPS participants. 

## Access and usage restrictions
Raw, digitized polysomnographic data with annotated stage files are accessible without restrictions for NAPS2. For NAPS1, only sleep data is available. The sources do not explicitly state whether commercial use is permitted.
